          There are always challenges in keeping a local business running, but this is too much. The impact that COVID-19 has had, on everyone, is having an undeniable impact on our local economy. Now, more than ever, it’s important to support eachother.
          <br>
          <br>
          That’s the goal of this project, and I invite anyone in our local business community, looking to offer or receive support, to join in.
